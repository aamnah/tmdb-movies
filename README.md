# E04 - Movies

![Movie app](./movie-app.png)
![Trailer modal](./movie-trailer-modal.png)

[DEMO](https://wuip-movies.netlify.app/)

- Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), [React](), [TypeScript](). 
- Deployed with [Netlify]()
- Uses [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-now-playing-list)

Environment variables are coming from Netlify

```bash
# npm run dev 
#http://localhost:3000/

# Run the app with Netlify
# if you want environment variables saved in Netlify build environment to be available
# for example: if your Netlify functions use API keys saved as env vars in Netlify
netlify dev
# http://localhost:8888
```

`netlify dev` will also take care of detecting and running the library/framework setup (React, CRA, Vite etc.); you do not need to run `npm run dev` separately
