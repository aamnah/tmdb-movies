[build]
# Base directory 
# directory where Netlify checks for dependency management files such as package.json or .nvmrc, installs dependencies, and runs your build command. The build system will use this directory to perform caching during the build process. If not set, the base directory defaults to the root of the repository.
base = "/" # / is default

# Build command
# the command to run to build your site if you are using a static site generator or other build tool. For example, npm run build. The build command runs in the Bash shell, allowing you to add Bash-⁠compatible syntax to the command. 
command = 'npm run build'

# Publish directory
# directory that contains the deploy-ready HTML files and assets generated by the build. The directory is relative to the base directory, which is root by default (/).
publish = 'build/'


# Production context: all deploys from the Production branch
# set in your site’s Branches settings in the UI will inherit
# these settings.
